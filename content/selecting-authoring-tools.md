_Authoring tools_ are tools that create web content, like CMSes, courseware, website creators and social media. If they take accesibility into account, authoring tools can make a huge difference for accessibility, both for content editors and for end users. This page explains how.

## Introduction

There are two parts to the accessibility of authoring tools: 

* [editing experience](#editing): does the tool work for people with disabilities?
* [output](#output): does the tool output accessible content?

On this page, we will list accessibility considerations for both of these parts. They can have their own, distinct benefits.

## Editing experience: for content editors

{:#editing}

* **Complies with accessibility standards**<br>
The full editing experience conforms to WCAG 2.0 (or another, platform-specific accessibility guidelines).
* **Provides text alternatives for icons, video etc**<br>
For “non-text content”, like icons and video, there is a text alternative, so that it can be perceived.
* **Status/properties conveyed to assistive technologies**<br>
Statuses like errors, spell check and changed content are conveyed to users of assistive technologies.
* **Works with keyboard**<br>
Everything that can be done with a mouse, can just as easily be done with other input methods, like keyboard.
* **Enough time**<br>
Time limits can be turned off or extended (some exceptions apply).
* **Flashing content optional**<br>
Flashing content, like videos, can be paused or turned off.
* **Content can be selected by structure**<br>
Users can navigate quicker by structure, for example headings, lists or HTML elements.
* **Content searchable**<br>
Users can search content.
* **Works with user display settings, like high contrast mode**<br>
If users have specific settings, like High Contrast Mode or their own stylesheet, this does not break the editing experience.
* **Previews are accessible**<br>
Previews should be as accessible as current browsers and other user agents.
* **Helps user prevent mistakes**<br>
Lets users undo changes and settings.
* **(Accessibility) features documented**<br>
Documents all features, including accessibility features.

## Further Considerations
{:#further}

These are some more things to look for when choosing an authoring tool that meets your (organisations's) accessibility needs:

### Accessibility statement provided

Most authoring tools conform only partly to accessibility guidelines. They may provide an accessibility statement that states what to expect from their product's accessibility.

### Governance of accesibility

Authoring tool products are likely regularly improved and updated. Updates could break accessibility, and it is recommended to check with the vendor what their process is for ensuring accessibility throughout their product's lifecycle. 

Some questions to ask: 

* Are new feature accessibility tested? 
* How can issues be reported? 

### Other features

The Authoring Tools List also lets you filter based on cost, license and technology.
